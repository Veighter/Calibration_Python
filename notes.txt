Robust and Easy to Implement Method for IMUY Calibration Without External Equipments

Procedure consists of 4 steps:
1. Collecting Data from N static positions (Compare to the in "Automatic Calibration for Inertial Measurement Unit")
2. Estimate T_init using the Allan Variance 
    -> Difference of the averages in consecutive intervals
3. Static Detector using Variance of Accelerometer Data
4. Computing Params of Acc using the given Sensor Error Model with Scaling Error and Axis Misalignments + Biases (12 Unknown Parameters)
